This is my first project with React.js.

I have built this project with the help of Create React App.

With Create React App, I can run these scripts:

npm start
To preview the project on my local host.

npm test
To launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

npm run eject
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
